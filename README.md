# Tina - AI Insurance Recommender

Tina is a conversational AI application that helps users choose the most suitable car insurance policy based on their needs. Powered by Google's Gemini API, Tina engages in natural dialogue to recommend from three policy types:

- **Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI)**  
- **Comprehensive Car Insurance**  
- **Third Party Car Insurance**

## ðŸš€ Features

- Conversational UI powered by React
- Dynamic insurance recommendations using Generative AI (Gemini)
- Business rules enforced (e.g., age limits, vehicle types)
- Dockerized frontend and backend for easy deployment

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Tina introduces herself and asks for consent to start the interview.
2. If the user agrees, Tina asks follow-up questions (generated via Gemini).
3. Based on the responses, Tina recommends a policy and justifies her choice.
